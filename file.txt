Mahin's About

I am a Computer Engineering Student at the University of South Florida expected to graduate in December of 2023. 
Since I joined USF, I have learned many skills from soft skills like Communication, Critical Thinking, and Teamwork 
to technical skills such as Programming Languages, Database Managing, and Code Reviewing just to name a few.
I hope to have an opportunity to use all my skills after I graduate where I can assist a team or even lead a team in projects.
